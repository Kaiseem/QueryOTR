# QueryOTR

## Outpainting by Queries, ECCV 2022.

In this work, we propose a novel hybrid vision-transformer-based encoder-decoder framework, named Query Outpainting TRansformer (QueryOTR), for extrapolating visual context all-side around a given image. Patch-wise mode's global modeling capacity allows us to extrapolate images from the attention mechanism's query standpoint. A novel Query Expansion Module (QEM) is designed to integrate information from the predicted queries based on the encoder's output, hence accelerating the convergence of the pure transformer even with a relatively small dataset. To further enhance connectivity between each patch, the proposed Patch Smoothing Module (PSM) re-allocates and averages the overlapped regions, thus providing seamless predicted images.
